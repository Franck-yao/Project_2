Sonar Rock vs Mine Detection
This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting the difference between rocks and mines using sonar signals. The model is trained on a dataset that includes sonar readings of different objects in the water, specifically rocks and mines, and it utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to classify the objects.

**Dataset**:
The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to data availability restrictions. However, you can obtain similar datasets from various sources, such as research institutions or government organizations. The dataset should include sonar readings of different objects in the water, along with corresponding labels indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine.

**Model Training**:
To train the sonar rock vs mine detection model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed and split into training and testing subsets. The preprocessing step typically involves cleaning the data, removing noise, and normalizing the features. The training set is then used to train the machine learning algorithm, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the testing set.

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook named sonar_detection.ipynb that guides you through the process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code examples for each step, making it easy for you to understand and reproduce the results.
